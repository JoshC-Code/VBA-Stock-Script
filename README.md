Due to Microsoft's security features the Excel file may not run the VBA script from the downloaded Stock API VBA.xlsm file. In case that happens, I have included a .txt file of the script, along with a copy of the Excel file without the script added. 
If the Stock API VBA.xlsm Excel file won't work you can follow these steps. 
1. Download the file Stock API VBA (Not Macro Enabled).xlsx
2. Enable editing on the Excel file.
3. Save the file as an Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook (*.xlsm).
4. Open the Developer tab in the new Macro-Enabled file.
5. Open the Visual Basic editor.
6. Right click under the 'ThisWorkbook' file in the Microsoft Excel Object in the upper left section of the editor.
7. Insert a Module.
8. Copy the code from the VBA Stock Script Code.txt file into the new module.
9. The script should now run by clicking the "Start" button in the worksheet.
